========================================
BioGPU Benchmark Project - Setup Complete
========================================
Date: 2025-11-11
Location: /home/david/projects/benchmark_biogpu/

READY TO GO! ✓

What We've Created:
-------------------
1. ✓ Complete directory structure
2. ✓ Conda environment YAML (bowtie2, htseq-count, samtools, Python tools)
3. ✓ Database setup script (creates bowtie2 index + GFF3 from biogpu DB)
4. ✓ GFF3 generator (parses biogpu FASTA headers for htseq-count)
5. ✓ Comprehensive documentation (README, QUICKSTART, guides)

Database Information:
--------------------
Source: /home/david/projects/biogpu/data/amr_stress_combined_db/
- DNA sequences: 14,280 genes (9,257 AMR + 5,023 stress)
- Protein sequences: 17,099 genes (9,538 AMR + 7,561 stress)

Traditional Pipeline Approach:
-----------------------------
Based on your existing scripts:
- bowtie2 (nucleotide alignment)
- htseq-count (read quantification)
- bedtools coverage (optional)

Same workflow as your /home/david/projects/ShellScripts/BT2*.sh scripts!

Next Steps:
-----------
1. Create conda environment:
   cd /home/david/projects/benchmark_biogpu
   mamba env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate benchmark_biogpu

2. Run database setup (10-15 min):
   ./scripts/01_setup_databases.sh

3. Select 10-20 test samples from NICU dataset
   (stratified by body site, location, timepoint)

4. Create traditional pipeline runner script
   (adapt your existing bowtie2 + htseq-count workflow)

5. Extract biogpu results for same samples

6. Compare and analyze!

Why This Matters:
----------------
- Validates your novel biogpu pipeline (translated search)
- Compares against established method (bowtie2 + htseq-count)
- Critical for reviewer response about AMR analysis methods
- Shows sensitivity gains from protein-space alignment
- Demonstrates concordance for conserved genes

Expected Timeline:
-----------------
- Database setup: 10-15 minutes
- Sample selection: 30 minutes
- Pipeline development: 1-2 hours
- Running pipelines: 2-4 hours (depends on # samples)
- Analysis/comparison: 1-2 hours
- Report generation: 1 hour

TOTAL: ~1 day of work for complete benchmark

All scripts are ready to run!
Just need to create the environment and execute.
